## Project Vision
The vision of the Tokenized Tuition Fee Voucher project is to modernize the management of educational funding by using blockchain technology to issue, manage, and track tuition fee vouchers. By tokenizing these vouchers, we aim to provide transparency, security, and efficiency in the process of tuition fee management, reducing fraud and administrative overhead.

## Key Features:

- **Voucher Redemption**: Vouchers can be redeemed only within the specified time period and by the rightful owner.
- **Admin Control**: The contract is controlled by an administrator, who has the authority to issue vouchers.
- **Unique Voucher IDs**: Each voucher has a unique ID to ensure it can be securely tracked and managed.
- **Voucher Expiry**: The contract ensures that vouchers can only be redeemed before their expiry date, providing an additional layer of security.
